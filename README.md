.htaccess for CodeIgniter
=============================

*".htaccess is a very ancient configuration file for web servers, and is one of the most powerful configuration files most webmasters will ever come across."* - http://www.askapache.com

Nothing more to add here... In this file I collated some helpful functions I use in my daily business. These are not particular for CodeIgniter and can be transfered to other Frameworks easily.

## How to start?

Download the file and place it in your root directory to play around and get in touch. I commented every part and gave it a base structure, nevertheless some things
might not work instantly on your server. The worst thing that can happen is a misconfiguration issue.
